# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I was thinking about creating a twitter bot that would post a video every single Friday 
of actor comedian Kevin Hart shouting "It's Friday, I feel good!" and then proceding to
dance to Accidentaly in Love by Counting Crows (which I have edited over the original video).


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

NA

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I have seen a couple tutorials online but is there any specific avenue I should go down to complete the project?
Tweety has been mentioned.

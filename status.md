Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have written the code for the bot and have been able to post multiple times successfully.
The last task I have to complete is automating the program to run at specific times.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The automation process. I've had the most trouble with this so far.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Installing tweepy was a little overwhelming along with keeping track of tke keys
and access codes that go along with building a twitter developer account. The video I originally
wanted my bot to post was too long so I decided to change videos
The content posted has changed, but the core of the twitter bot is still there.
